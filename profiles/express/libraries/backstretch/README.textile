h1. jQuery Backstretch

Backstretch is a jQuery plugin that allows you to add a dynamically-resized background image to any page.
The image will stretch to fit the page, and will automatically resize as the window size changes.

h2. Demo

There are a couple of examples included with this package, or feel free to check it out live "on the project page itself.":http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/jquery-backstretch/

h2. Options

h3. centeredX

The ratio of the width/height of the image doesn't always jive with the width/height of the window. This parameter controls whether or not we center the image on the X axis to account for the discrepancy. (type=Boolean, default=true)

h3. centeredY

This parameter controls whether or not we center the image on the Y axis to account for the aforementioned discrepancy. (type=Boolean, default=true)

h3. speed

This is the speed at which the image will fade in, after downloading is complete. Integers are accepted, as well as standard jQuery speed strings (slow, normal, fast). (type=Integer, default=0)


h2. Setup

Include the jQuery library and Backstretch plugin files in your webpage (preferably at the bottom of the page, before the closing BODY tag):

<pre><code><script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/jquery.backstretch.min.js"></script>
</code></pre>

Note: The example above uses the Google hosted version of jQuery; there is also a jQuery source file included with this distribution, if you would like to host it yourself.

<pre><code><script type="text/javascript">
  $.backstretch("/path/to/image.jpg", {speed: 150});
</script>
</code></pre>

Want to change the image after Backstretch has been loaded? No problem, just call it again!

<pre><code><script type="text/javascript">
  $.backstretch("/path/to/image.jpg", {speed: 150});
  
  // Perhaps you'd like to change the image on a button click
  $(".button").click(function() {
      $.backstretch("/path/to/next_image.jpg");
  });
</script>
</code></pre>

h2. Changelog

h3. Version 1.2

* You can now called backstretch twice, and it will replace the existing image.

h3. Version 1.1

* Removed 'hideUntilReady' option. It looks pretty bad if you don't hide the image until it's fully loaded.
