# Express Installation Profile
The Express installation profile is developed and maintained by the University of Colorado Boulder where it is provided at no charge for college/school, academic and administrative department, and research group, lab and institute websites through the [Web Express service](http://www.colorado.edu/webcentral/). 

This is a customized installation profile of the [Drupal content management system](https://www.drupal.org/) and publicly mainly for reference beyond developers working at other schools in the University of Colorado system. We do provide support for several key elments we've developed for Express.  Those can be found at https://www.drupal.org/project/express
