 * Pathologic filter callback.

 * Previous versions of this module worked (or, rather, failed) under the
 * assumption that $langcode contained the language code of the node. Sadly,
 * this isn't the case.
 * @see http://drupal.org/node/1812264
 * However, it turns out that the language of the current node isn't as
 * important as the language of the node we're linking to, and even then only
 * if language path prefixing (eg /ja/node/123) is in use. REMEMBER THIS IN THE
 * FUTURE, ALBRIGHT.
 *
 * The below code uses the @ operator before parse_url() calls because in PHP
 * 5.3.2 and earlier, parse_url() causes a warning of parsing fails. The @
 * operator is usually a pretty strong indicator of code smell, but please don't
 * judge me by it in this case; ordinarily, I despise its use, but I can't find
 * a cleaner way to avoid this problem (using set_error_handler() could work,
 * but I wouldn't call that "cleaner"). Fortunately, Drupal 8 will require at
 * least PHP 5.3.5, so this mess doesn't have to spread into the D8 branch of
 * Pathologic.
 * @see https://drupal.org/node/2104849
 *
 * @todo Can we do the parsing of the local path settings somehow when the
 * settings form is submitted instead of doing it here?
