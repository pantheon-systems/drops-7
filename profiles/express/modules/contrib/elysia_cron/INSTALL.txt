UPGRADE A NEW VERSION
----------------------

If you are upgrading from an old version of elysia_cron you should simply 
replace module files. You don't even need to execute the "update.php" drupal
process: Elysia cron will detect the new version on its first run and updates
itself automatically.


INSTALLATION 
-------------

For the basic install you only need to enable the module and Elysia Cron will be
up and running.

You can stop here if you don't need a great precision over task execution and
you don't have to execute a task more often than once an hour.  
For example, if you need only the "Once a day", "Once a week" or "Once a month" 
schedule rules the basic install is fine.

Instead, if you need:
- to run some tasks more often than once an hour (eg: you have a function that
  should be executed every 5 minutes)
- to execute a task at an exact time (eg:you must run a function at exactly 
  "17:23") 
... you must follow Step B


STEP B: CHANGE SYSTEM CRONTAB (OPTIONAL)
-----------------------------------------

To get the full potential out of elysia cron and have the full control over you
tasks a further step is needed: you need to configure the system crontab to
execute drupal cron every minute.

To do this refer to the section "Configuring cron jobs" of drupal documentation:
http://drupal.org/cron

The only difference is that you should use the "* * * * *" rule part instead of
"0 * * * *" or "45 * * * *" as described in the guide.

While you're editing the system crontab, it's also recommended to replace the
"/cron.php" part with "/sites/all/modules/elysia_cron/cron.php" (if you have
installed elysia_cron in "sites/all/modules" directory).
This is an optional step (you can leave "/cron.php" if you want), doing it will 
result in a better performance in bigger sites (elysia_cron's cron.php handles 
cache in a better way).

For example: 
* * * * * wget -O - -q -t 1 http://www.example.com/sites/all/modules/elysia_cron/cron.php

IF YOU WANT TO ENABLE CRON KEY SECURITY...

... you should also add the choosen cron key (from elysia_cron setup) to the
call.

Example: 
* * * * * wget -O - -q -t 1 http://www.example.com/sites/all/modules/elysia_cron/cron.php?cron_key=12345678

That's all, now you can go the the cron administration page to configure your
tasks.
(NOTE: In D7, having a system crontab defined, you can set the "Run cron on 
visitor's requests, every" setting to "Never")

By default elysia_cron will run all standard cron jobs sequentially (in a
single channel) once an hour. You can change this behavious with elysia_cron
setup.

To access elysia_cron setup, and change the scheduling of your jobs or view
execution stats, go to cron page from administration menu.

Note: to better see warnings on administration page you should consider adding
a rule for "warn" class to theme CSS stylesheet, like this one: .warn { color:
red; font-weight: bold; }


PERMISSIONS
------------

There are three permission provided by module:
 * Administer elysia cron - Perform changes to cron jobs timings, disable cron
 or single jobs and access cron execution statistics;
 * Execute elysia cron jobs - Allow users to view statistics, execution status
 and do manually execute cron jobs;
 * View elysia cron stats - Allows users to view statistics and execution status
 of cron jobs;
