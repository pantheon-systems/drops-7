<strong>Use AJAX: No</strong>
If set, this view will use an AJAX mechanism for paging, table sorting and exposed filters. This prevents the entire page from refreshing. It is not recommended that you use this if this view is the main content of the page as it will prevent deep linking to specific pages, but it is very useful for side content. Block displays require this setting to be ON if exposed filters are being used.

<strong>Hide attachments in summary: No</strong>

<strong>Use aggregation: No</strong>
All fields that are selected for grouping will be collapsed to one record per distinct value. Other fields which are selected for aggregation will have the function run on them. For example, you can group nodes on title and count the number of nids in order to get a list of duplicate titles.
For more Information how aggregation work see the "Use Aggregation" Help Page
