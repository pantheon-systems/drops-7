A summary of tests to do manually.  These should all be duplicated in simpletests.
Queries for group memberships and nested group memberships are in the LDAP Servers
module.  LDAP Authorization testing is thus about the actual granting of drupal
roles, og group memberships, etc.



Event Handlers to Test
[x] When a user logs on.


Mappings Model:
Mapping of LDAP to drupal role (one per line)
[x] Only grant drupal roles that match a filter above
[x] Convert full dn to value of first attribute before mapping.



Flags to Test:

[x] Enable this Configuration
[x] Revoke drupal roles previously granted by LDAP Authorization but no longer valid.
[x] Re grant drupal roles previously granted by LDAP Authorization but removed manually.
[x] Create drupal roles if they do not exist.


Data Structures to Test:


$user->ldap_authorizations
