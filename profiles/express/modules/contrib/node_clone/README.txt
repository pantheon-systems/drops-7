README file for "Node clone" (clone.module) for Drupal 7.x.

The clone module allows users to make a copy of an existing node and then edit
that copy. The authorship is set to the current user, the menu and url aliases
are reset, and the (localized) words "Clone of" are inserted into the title to
remind you that you are not editing the original node.

Users with the "Clone any node" or "Clone own nodes" permission can utilize
this functionality. An action link will appear on node pages with the text
"Clone content". Depending on the setting you choose there are two possible 
actions that will occur when you click that link. Each of these is a different
cloning "method".

The default method works by pre-populating the node form, rather than immediately
saving a copy of the original node to the database.  Thus, your node will not be
saved until you hit "Submit" (just like if you went to node/add/x).

The alternative method that may be selected immediately saves the node (by
default the user must confirm this action on a confirmation form). This may
work better in some cases, but also means that the copied node may immediately
show up on the front page or in RSS feeds even while you are editing it.

This module makes reasonable checks on access permissions.  A user cannot clone
a node unless they have permission to create new nodes of that type based on a
call to node_access().

Settings can be accessed at admin/config/content/clone.  On this page you can
set whether the publishing options are reset when making a clone of a node.
This is set for each node type individually.

This module seems to work with common node types, however YMMV, especially with
nodes that have any sort of image or file  attachments.   In all cases, but
especially if you are using a complex or custom node type, you should
evaluate this module on a test site with a copy of your database before
attempting to use it on a live site. On the settings page you may choose
node types to be omitted from the cloning mechanism - no users will be able
to clone a node of an omitted type.

This module makes no attempt to respect field-level permissions.
You should test your configuration carefully or not allow access
to the clone functionality for non-admins if you rely on field-level
permissions for important site features.

To install this module, copy the folder with all the files to the
/sites/all/modules  OR /sites/default/modules directory of your Drupal
installation and enable it at /admin/build/modules.  Two new permissions are
available, but there are no changes to the database structure.
