<h2 id="project-description">Synopsis</h2>

<p>The <strong>Advanced help</strong> module provides a framework that allows
module and theme developers integrate help texts in a Drupal site.</p>

<p>These help texts are stored in ordinary <code>.html</code>-files
that lives in the file system (as opposed to the database).  These
files are distributed from the project Drupal.org repo in the same
package as the module or theme, and placed in a subdirectory named
<code>help</code> in the project or theme directory.  This means that
the help texts can be easiely kept in sync with the project they
provide help texts for, but also that read access to these files
are not managed by any content access restrictions imposed by Drupal.</p>
  
<p>The help texts can be marked up with standard HTML. They will be
rendered using your site's theme.</p>

<p>If the module or theme author does not make use of the
<em>Advanced help</em> HTML-framework, but if there is a
<code>README.md</code> or <code>README.txt</code> in the package,
the content of that file will be shown instead.</p>
  
<p>The help texts may appear in a popup or not as the project prefers.
By taking away access to view the popups, a site can hide popups from
users.</p>

<p>The help texts can be placed in a hierarchy, allowing for top down
navigation of help.</p>

<p>The help texts may be made searchable. If advanced help search is
enabled, all help texts are fully indexed. This means that the entire
contents of the advanced help set of pages can be searched for
keywords.</p>

<h2 id="use">Using the module</h2>

<p>When you enable the module, a new tab with the legend “Advanced
help” will show up under “Help”:

<div class="ta-center">
<img class="help-img-center" alt="ahelp_tab.png" src="&path&ahelp_tab.png" width="661" height="225" border="1" />
</div>

<p>By itself, this module doesn't do much.  The <strong>Advanced
help</strong> assists other modules and themes in showing help texts.
Nothing will show up until you enable at least one other module that
makes use of the advanced help framework or comes with a file
named <code>README.md</code> or <code>README.txt</code>.  However, it
comes with a small companion demo module named
<strong>Advanced help example</strong> to demonstrate how it works.
For more extensive example of use of the advanced help features, see
the <strong>Views</strong> project.</p>

<h2 id="support-status">Support status</h2>

<p>Reported bugs for the Drupal 7 branch will be fixed in a timely
manner.  Bugs in the issue queue for the Drupal 6 branch will only be
fixed if accompanied with a patch, after the patch has been reviewed
and tested by the community.  No Drupal 8 version is currently under
development.  Post a message in
the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/1928218">issue queue</a> if
you're interested in managing a port of the project to to Drupal
8. Older versions are no longer supported.</p>

<p>Community support in the form of patches are very welcome for both
Drupal 6 and Drupal 7 versions, and will be given priority. For QA,
the project needs community support in the form of reviews of patches,
development versions and releases.</p>

<p>The primary goal of the module is to remain <strong>light-weight
and simple</strong>.  This means that not all feature requests will be
implemented, even if they are a good idea.  Feature requests
accompanied by patches are more likely to make it into a release.</p>

<p>The maintainer hopes that the community is willing to help out by
answering &amp; closing support requests.</p>
