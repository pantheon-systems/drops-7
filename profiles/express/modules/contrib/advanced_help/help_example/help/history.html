<p>PHP, standing for Personal Home Page, began as a set of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface" title="Common Gateway Interface">Common Gateway Interface</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_file" title="Binary file">binaries</a> written in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_programming_language" class="mw-redirect" title="C programming language">C programming language</a> in 1994 by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_people" title="Danish people">Danish</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland" title="Greenland">Greenlandic</a> programmer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasmus_Lerdorf" title="Rasmus Lerdorf">Rasmus Lerdorf</a>. Lerdorf initially created these Personal Home Page Tools to replace a small set of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl" title="Perl">Perl</a> scripts he had been using to maintain his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_homepage" class="mw-redirect" title="Personal homepage">personal homepage</a>. The tools were originally created to perform tasks such as displaying his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9sum%C3%A9" title="Résumé">résumé</a> and recording how much <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_traffic" title="Web traffic">traffic</a> his page was receiving. He combined these binaries with his Form Interpreter to create PHP/FI, which had more functionality. It included a larger <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29" title="C (programming language)">C implementation</a> which could communicate with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database" title="Database">databases</a> and helped build simple, dynamic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application" title="Web application">web applications</a>. He released PHP publicly on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_8" title="June 8">June 8</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995" title="1995">1995</a> to speed up the finding of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug" title="Software bug">bugs</a> and improving the code. This release was named PHP version 2, and already had basic functionality that PHP has today. This includes Perl-like variables, form handling, and the ability to embed HTML. The syntax was similar to Perl but was more limited, simpler, and less consistent.</p>

The development team officially released PHP/FI 2 in November 1997 after months of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_stage#beta" class="mw-redirect" title="Development stage">beta</a> testing. Afterwards, public testing of PHP 3 began, and the official launch came in June 1998. Suraski and Gutmans then started a new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rewrite_%28programming%29" title="Rewrite (programming)">rewrite</a> of PHP's core, producing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zend_Engine" title="Zend Engine">Zend Engine</a> in 1999.

On <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_13" title="July 13">July 13</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004" title="2004">2004</a>, PHP 5 was released and is powered by the new Zend Engine II. PHP 5 included new features such as improved support for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming" title="Object-oriented programming">object-oriented programming</a>, the PHP Data Objects extension (which defines a lightweight and consistent interface for accessing databases), and numerous performance enhancements. The most recent update released by The PHP Group is for the older PHP version 4 code branch. As of January 2008, this branch is up to version 4.4.8. PHP 4 will be supported by security updates until <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_8" title="August 8">August 8</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008" title="2008">2008</a>.</p>

<p>PHP 5 is the only stable version still being developed. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_static_binding" class="mw-redirect" title="Late static binding">Late static binding</a> has been missing from PHP and will be added in version 5.3. Development on PHP 4 ceased at the end of 2007, except for the critical security updates for PHP 4 already mentioned. PHP 6 is now under development and major changes include the removal of <code>register_globals</code>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_quotes" title="Magic quotes">magic quotes</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_mode#Application_software_safe_mode" title="Safe mode">safe mode</a>. PHP does not have complete native support for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/Unicode" title="Unicode">Unicode</a> or multibyte strings; unicode support will be added in PHP 6. Many high profile open source projects ceased to support PHP 4 in new code as of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_5" title="February 5">February 5</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008" title="2008">2008</a>, due to the GoPHP5 initiative, provided by a consortium of PHP developers promoting the transition from PHP 4 to PHP 5.</p>
