The Tesox typeface
==================

The Tesox typeface is created by Stefaan Lippens (also known as soxofaan on
drupal.org, http://drupal.org/user/41478).
It is based on hand drawn characters, converted to a TrueType font with the
FontCapture web service (http://www.fontcapture.com).

Background
----------
The Tesox typeface is created specifically for the image CAPTCHA module
for Drupal (http://drupal.org/project/captcha). For a better out-of-the-box
experience it was desired to include one or more typefaces with the CAPTCHA
module package by default. However, this redistribution raised licensing issues.
For example, according the code hosting policy of drupal.org, only GPL licensed
code and resources are allowed in the drupal.org code repository (CVS).
To avoid licensing and redistribution issues, it was decided to create a
dedicated typeface for the image CAPTCHA module from scratch.

Licencing
---------
The Tesox typeface is GPLv2 licenced to be compatible with the drupal.org code
hosting and packaging policies, as explained above.
