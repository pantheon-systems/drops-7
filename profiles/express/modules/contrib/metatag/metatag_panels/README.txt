Metatag: Panels
-----------------
This module adds support for meta tag configuration for Panels pages.

Configuration is done within the "Metatag" tab existent in the Page Manager
variant configuration page.


Known Issues
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Only contexts of a type that is supported by the Token API work.
- Only one context for each type is currently supported. If you have two 'node'
contexts, only the first node is elligible for replacement.
