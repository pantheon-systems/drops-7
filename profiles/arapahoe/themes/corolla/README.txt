-- SUMMARY --

Corolla is a stylized, re-colorable, multi-column theme which uses HTML5
and includes many advanced theme settings to allow you to customize 
the theme to your requirements.


-- REQUIREMENTS --

Corolla 7.x-2.x is a sub-theme of Adaptivetheme, you must download and install
this theme first. You do not need to enable it.

http://drupal.org/project/adaptivetheme (take the latest 7.x-2.x version).


-- INSTALLATION --

Install as usual, see http://drupal.org/node/70151 for further information.


-- CONFIGURATION --

* Theme settings and layout: Corolla includes lots of theme settings including
  the ability to change the layout and support for mobile devices. Visit the
  theme settings page admin/appearance/settings/corolla to configure your settings.
  You can change the layout, font, font size, heading styles and much more.
  In due course we will write documentation pages about each block of settings.
  
  For additional help please view the online documentation:
  http://adaptivethemes.com/documentation/layout-settings-guide

* Color options: Enable the theme at admin/appearance, and visit
  admin/appearance/settings/corolla to modify the color scheme if desired.

* Menus: The corolla theme does not support the hard coded menu defaults. To setup
  your main navigation menu, place the block containing the menu you want in the
  "Menu Bar" region.


-- SUPERFISH DROP MENUS --

corolla supports the Superfish module which is a dynamic menu module and enables 
drop menus and other styles. First configure the Superfish menu to use the "none" 
style and then place the menu in the "Menu Bar" region. Placing a Superfish menu
into the "Header" region will also enable a styled drop menu, one of my "easter egg"
features :)

Superfish installation instructions and downloads can be found on the Superfish 
menu project page:

http://drupal.org/project/superfish
