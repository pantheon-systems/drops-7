/**
 * Main info hook that features uses to determine what components are provided
 * by the implementing module.
 *
 * @return array
 *   An array of components, keyed by the component name. Each component can
 *   define several keys:
 *
 *   'file': Optional path to a file to include which contains the rest
 *   of the features API hooks for this module.
 *
 *   'default_hook': The defaults hook for your component that is called
 *   when the cache of default components is generated. Examples include
 *   hook_views_default_views() or hook_context_default_contexts().
 *
 *   'default_file': The file-writing behavior to use when exporting this
 *   component. May be one of 3 constant values:
 *
 *   FEATURES_DEFAULTS_INCLUDED_COMMON: write hooks/components to
 *   `.features.inc` with other components. This is the default behavior
 *   if this key is not defined.
 *
 *   FEATURES_DEFAULTS_INCLUDED: write hooks/components to a component-
 *   specific include named automatically by features.
 *
 *   FEATURES_DEFAULTS_CUSTOM: write hooks/components to a component-
 *   specific include with a custom name provided. If your module provides
 *   large amounts of code that should not be parsed often (only on specific
 *   cache clears/rebuilds, for example) you should use the 2nd or 3rd
 *   options to split your component into its own include.
 *
 *   'default_filename': The filename to use when 'default_file' is set to
 *   FEATURES_DEFAULTS_CUSTOM.
 *
 *   'feature_source': Boolean value for whether this component should be
 *   offered as an option on the initial feature creation form.
 *
 *   'base': Optional. An alternative base key to use when calling features
 *   hooks for this component. Can be used for features component types that
 *   are declared "dynamically" or are part of a family of components.
 *
 *   'alter_type': What type of alter hook this hook uses. 'normal' is called
 *   after the main hook is called. 'inline' is embeded within the default hook
 *   and may not be implemented by some default hooks.
 *   'none' is no alter hook exists. Defaults to 'normal'
 *
 *   'alter_hook': What the name of the alter hook for this component is.
 *    Do not include the '_alter' part. Defaults to 'default_hook'.

/**
 * Component hook. The hook should be implemented using the name of the
 * component, not the module, eg. [component]_features_export() rather than
 * [module]_features_export().
 *
 * Process the export array for a given component. Implementations of this hook
 * have three key tasks:
 *
 * 1. Determine module dependencies for any of the components passed to it
 *   e.g. the views implementation iterates over each views' handlers and
 *   plugins to determine which modules need to be added as dependencies.
 *
 * 2. Correctly add components to the export array. In general this is usually
 *   adding all of the items in $data to $export['features']['my_key'], but
 *   can become more complicated if components are shared between features
 *   or modules.
 *
 * 3. Delegating further detection and export tasks to related or derivative
 *   components.
 *
 * Each export processor can kickoff further export processors by returning a
 * keyed array (aka the "pipe") where the key is the next export processor hook
 * to call and the value is an array to be passed to that processor's $data
 * argument. This allows an export process to start simply at a few objects:
 *
 * [context]
 *
 * And then branch out, delegating each component to its appropriate hook:
 *
 * [context]--------+------------+
 *     |            |            |
 *   [node]      [block]      [views]
 *     |
 *   [CCK]
 *     |
 * [imagecache]

 *   By reference. An array of all components to be exported with a given
 *   feature. Component objects that should be exported should be added to
 *   this array.
 * @param string $module_name
 *   The name of the feature module to be generated.

 *   The pipe array of further processors that should be called.
