<h2>Troubleshooting UI crashes</h2>

There are a number of reasons why the Views UI may crash; the most common state or result of a crash is either a white screen (everyone's favorite WSOD), or a screen of what looks like garbage text. This is generally a javascript crash of some fashion.

To get the most timely and accurate help in the issue queue, please try to gather this information:

Check your javascript console. In Firefox, you can hit ctrl-shift-j or use firebug. Copy this information into the issue, or attach it as a text file. Really - this is the single biggest thing you can do to help figure out where the crash is coming from.


<h3>JSON prepends data with jQuery, causing editing and preview problems.</h3>
This section originally stems from <a href="http://drupal.org/node/346662">this issue.</a>

Some modules may add PHP improperly, disrupting normal jQuery operation. Errors may look like

<code>
<? session_module_name("files"); ?>{ "default": "default" }
</code>

This can also be a server configuration issue. In one case, this was solved by commenting out

auto_prepend_file = c:\wamp\www\php.ini.prepend

in the php.ini.
