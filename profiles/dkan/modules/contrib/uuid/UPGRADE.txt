This document describes how to upgrade between major and minor versions of the
UUID module.

Upgrading between all major and minor versions have been successfully tested
when following the steps described in UPGRADE.txt from Drupal core, with
addition to the notes in this document.

Taking full backups of your files and database is always recommended before
doing any upgrades.

UPGRADING FROM UUID 6.x to UUID 7.x
-----------------------------------

In addition to the steps described by UPGRADE.txt from Drupal core, you need to
follow these notes:

  * Before upgrading, update to the latest UUID 6.x-1.x-dev

  * When doing your upgrade, you must first upgrade to UUID 7.x-1.0-alpha1 in
    order to not lose any data during the upgrade. The reason is because the
    sub-modules responsible for the data migration between 6.x and 7.x was
    removed after the release of UUID 7.x-1.0-alpha1.

  * After upgrading to UUID 7.x-1.0-alpha1 you can proceed upgrading to later
    versions of UUID.

UPGRADING FROM UUID 7.x-1.0-alpha1 TO LATER VERSION
---------------------------------------------------

Make sure to follow these notes when upgrading from 7.x-1.0-alpha1 to later
versions:

  * Before upgrading, disable UUID and all UUID sub-modules.

  * Run update.php.

  * Enable the UUID module. The entity specific UUID sub-modules doesn't exist
    anymore. They are replaced with more efficient functionality in the UUID
    module. No data is lost.
