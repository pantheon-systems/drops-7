Field Hidden 7.x-1.1

New features
------------
None, except for added readme.txt and better help page.

Bug fixes
---------
The 'display default value in instance settings' feature is now something that can be turned off, instead of turned on.
Getting default value displayed was hitherto practically impossible (thanks rhclayto, for creating issue http://drupal.org/node/1440574).
