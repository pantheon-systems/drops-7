TAXONOMY MENU
=============

Upgrading from 6.1 => 6.2
=========================
1. Copy new version to sites/all/modules/taxonomy_menu
2. Run update.php

If that doesn't work then follow:
1. Disable the module at admin/build/modules
2. Uninstall the module at admin/build/modules/uninstall
3. Copy new version to sites/all/modules/taxonomy_menu
4. Enable the new version at admin/build/modules

See README.TXT for configuration options.

The best method is to treat this upgrade as a new module.
The setting of the previous version will not be upgraded.
