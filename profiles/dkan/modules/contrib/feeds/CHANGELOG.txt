- #994026 tristanoneil: Optionally defuse email addresses.

Feeds 7.x 2.0 Alpha 2, 2010-11-02
---------------------------------

- #940866 tristanoneil: PHP 5.3 FeedsImporter::copy function must be compatible.
- #944986 tristanoneil: Link Mapper Upgrade.
- #959066 tristanoneil: Remove old mappers and tests.

  files.csv dynamically.
- #953538 yhahn: Remove BOM from UTF-8 files.
  Adds sanitizeFile() and sanitizeRaw() methods to FeedsFetcherResult.
  Extending classes that override either the getRaw() or getFilePath() methods
  should call these sanitization methods to ensure that the returned output /
  file has been cleaned for parsing.
- #606612 alex_b: More detailed log.
- #949236 Ian Ward, alex_b: Allow mapping empty values to fields.

- Allow for mapping to list_number field types.
- Fix entity inspection in file fetcher.
- #932772 alex_b: FeedsProcessor: Consolidate process() and clear().
  FeedsProcessor now implements the process() and clear() methods for creating
  and deleting entities. The extending processors FeedsNodeProcessor,
  FeedsTermProcessor and FeedsUserProcessor merely implement entity manipulation
  methods (newEntity(), entityLoad(), entitySave(), entityDeleteMultiple()...).
  This brings features previously only available on FeedsNodeProcessor to all
  entity processors: fast change detection on imported items with hashes,
  batching on process() and clear() and in the case of FeedsUserProcessor, the
  actual implementation of clear(). Together with #929066 this is a further
  step towards harmonizing features of processor plugins.

  type.
- #728534 alex_b: Remove FeedsFeedNodeProcessor. If you have used
  FeedsFeedNodeProcessor in the past, use FeedsNodeProcessor (Node Processor)
  instead now. It supports all of FeedsFeedNodeProcessor's functionality and
  more.
- #929066 alex_b: Track all imported items. Note: All views that use 'Feeds
  Item' fields or relationships need updating.
- #930018 alex_b: Don't show file upload when 'Supply path directly' is
  selected.
- #927892 alex_b: Add "Process in background" feature. Allows one-off imports to
  be processed in the background rather than using Batch API. Useful for very
  large imports.
- #929058 alex_b: Report status of source on import and delete forms, track
  last updated time on a source level.
- #928836: Set progress floating point directly. Note: fetchers and parsers
  must use $state->progress() for setting the batch progress now IF they support
  batching.
- #928728: Track source states by stage, not by plugin. Note: call signature of
  FeedsSource::state() has changed.
- Remove 6.x upgrade hooks.
- #923318: Fix Fatal error: Call to a member function import() on a non-object
  occurring on cron.
- Clean up basic settings form.
- Make getConfig() include configuration defaults.
