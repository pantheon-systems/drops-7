Migrate 2.6
===========

IMPORTANT CHANGES SINCE MIGRATE 2.5
-----------------------------------
Migration developers will need to add the "advanced migration information"
permission to their roles to continue seeing all the info in the UI they're
used to.

Auto-registration (having classes be registered just based on their class name,
with no call to registerMigration or definition in hook_migrate_api()) is no
longer supported. Registration of classes defined in hook_migrate_api() is no
longer automatic - do a drush migrate-register or use the Register button in the
UI to register them.

Migration class constructors should now always accept an $arguments array as
the first parameter and pass it to its parent. This version does support legacy
migrations which pass a group object, or nothing, but these methods are
deprecated.

Features and enhancements
- #2390229 - Make literal strings monolithic.
- #2391789 - Add extender getter to better support extending wizards.
- #2363015 - Add support for modifying wizards defined by other modules.

- #2306953 - Give basic users a little more information.
- #2261357 - Add prepareCallback/completeCallback to table destination.
- #2306923 - Propagate message statuses to drupal_set_message in batch.
- #2301679 - Display all source key fields in the message view.
- #2312075 - Add --ignore-highwater option to drush imports

             be cleanly skipped by throwing exceptions.
- #2017835 - Add MigrateFileUriAsIs file class, and make file migrations more
             flexible.
- #2004426 - UI support for editing dependencies; enable setting dependencies
             through arguments.
- #1826112 - A new API has been added to support external modules in developing
             easy-to-use wizard-based UIs.
- #1833380 - Major refactoring of the UI, breaking groups and migrations
             (tasks) into separate pages, introducing an advanced permission and
             presenting a simplified UI to those with only the basic permission.
- #1860450 - The UI now has the capability of spawning import/rollback operations
             in drush, with email notifications of completion. The notification
             ability is available when running drush at the command line, which
             may be useful for running imports via cron.
- #1996602 - A default field handler is now provided that should handle many if
             not most field types without custom handlers.
- #1901980 - Support encrypting particular arguments saved to the database, to
             support wizard implementations that may be prompting for secure
             database credentials.
- #1896096 - Add ability to define field mappings via arguments at registration
             time, and use those to override mappings in code.

             be explicitly set DNM.

Migrate 2.5
===========

IMPORTANT: Automatic registration of new migration classes is no longer done on
a cache clear. Depending on automatic registration is now deprecated, and you
are encouraged to implement your migrations as DynamicMigration and explicitly
register them via hook_migrate_api() or MigrationBase::registerMigration().
If your migrations are not explicitly registered, you must request auto-registration
with a "drush mar" (drush migrate-auto-register) command, or by clicking the
"Register" button at admin/content/migrate/registration.

Features and enhancements
- #1824024 - Destination and field handlers may now be registered through
             hook_migrate_api(). Automatic registration of all migration and
             handler classes may be disabled at admin/content/migrate/registration.

             is now at admin/content/migrate/handlers.
