 * Yes, there is no code in the .module file. Migrate operates almost entirely
 * through classes, and by adding any files containing class definitions to the
 * .info file, those files are automatically included only when the classes they
 * contain are referenced. The one non-class piece you need to implement is
 * hook_migrate_api(), but because .migrate.inc is registered using
 * hook_hook_info, by defining your implementation of that hook in
 * example.migrate.inc, it is automatically invoked only when needed.
