The Migrate Extras module provides extensions to Migrate (http://drupal.org/project/migrate)
to support various contributed modules. The ideal place to implement migration support
for a contributed module is in that module. That way, the migration support is always
self-consistent with the current module implementation - it's not practical for the
migrate_extras module to keep up with changes to all other contrib modules. Support
for contributed modules may be added to migrate_extras for two reasons - if the module's
maintainer does not accept a patch providing migration support, or as an intermediate
step before submitting such a patch to the other module.

In cases where modules supported by migrate_extras end up implementing the support
themselves, you could at least temporarily end up with redundant implementations.
The extra implementation may be disabled at admin/content/migrate/configure.

The following modules are currently supported in Migrate Extras on Drupal 7 (note
that Date module support has moved into the Date module itself):

Address Field
Entity API
Flag
Geofield
Interval
Media
Name Field
Pathauto
Phone Number (cck_phone)
