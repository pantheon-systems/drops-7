This folder includes files that can be used to test imports of date information.
To test them, set up FeedAPI and the Feed Element Mapper with Parser iCal
or Parser CVS and import these files into a date field.

- rrule.ics:
  Creates repeating dates using a wide variety of RRULEs.

- Yahoo.csv:
  This file uses the csv export format from Yahoo Calendar, similar to the
  format created by Outlook's csv export. The sample contains both timed
  and untimed 'All day' events.

- USHolidays.ics:
  An ical export of US Holidays in the 'All day' format used by
  Microsoft and Apple (where the Start date is the date of the event
  and the End date is the following day).
