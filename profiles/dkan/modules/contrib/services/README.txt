==============
- Create a unified Drupal API for web services to be exposed in a variety of
  different server formats.
- Provide a service browser to be able to test methods.
- Allow distribution of API keys for developer access.

Documentation

Once downloaded you need to add spyc.php to the rest_server/lib folder which exists under
