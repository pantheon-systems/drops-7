This is used when you want to position the exposed form in the sidebar or anywhere else, but not with the view. Instead, a block will be made available to the Drupal block administration system, and the exposed form will appear there. Note that this block must be enabled manually, Views will not enable it for you.
To do this select "Exposed form in block: Yes" and choose one option from "Exposed form style".
