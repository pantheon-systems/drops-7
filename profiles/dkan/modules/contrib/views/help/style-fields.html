The <strong>fields</strong> row style displays each field defined in the view, one after another. Each field defines its own output.

By default, each field is put in a &lt;div&gt; unless it is selected to be <em>inline</em>. If it is inline, it is put in a &lt;span&gt;. Two items in &lt;div&gt;s will be displayed one after another, with the second one below the first. Two items in &lt;span&gt;s will be displayed on the same line. One item in a &lt;span&gt; next to &lt;div&gt;s is the same as two items in &lt;div&gt;s. This means that for the <em>inline</em> setting to do anything, at least two consecutive items must be set inline.

You may define a <i>separator</i> which will be placed between each item. This separator may be html. You can use &amp;nbsp; to print blank space.

If the view's row style is set to "fields", fields must be added to the View. If there are no fields, you may receive validation errors such as:

<i>* Display "Defaults" uses fields but there are none defined for it or all are excluded.
* Display "Page" uses fields but there are none defined for it or all are excluded.</i>

This is because the row style "fields" expects at least one field for display.

There is also an option to hide empty fields, so empty fields, along with their labels or markup will not be displayed.
