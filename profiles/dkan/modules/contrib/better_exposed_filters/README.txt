-- SUMMARY --

The Better Exposed Filters module replaces the Views' default single-
or multi-select boxes with radio buttons or checkboxes, respectively.

Views Filters are a powerful tool to limit the results of a given view.
When you expose a filter, you allow the user to interact with the view
making it easy to build a customized advanced search.  For example,
exposing a taxonomy filter lets your site visitor search for articles
with specific tags.  Better Exposed Filters gives you greater control
over the rendering of exposed filters.
