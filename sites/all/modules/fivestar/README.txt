The Fivestar voting module adds a clean, attractive voting widget to nodes and
comments in Drupal. It features:

 * jQuery rollover effects and AJAX no-reload voting
 * Customizable star sets
 * Graceful degradation to an HTML rating form when JavaScript is turned off
 * Per-nodetype configurability
 * Support for anonymous voters
 * Spam protection to keep users from filling your DB with bogus votes
 * Easy-to-use integration with Views module for lists sorted by rating, or filtered by min/max ratings
 * A Fivestar CCK field for use in custom node types
 * An easy-to-use Form API element type for use in other modules

Fivestar was designed by Nate Haug and Jeff Eaton.

Dependencies
------------
 * votingapi

Fivestar also provides additional features for both the CCK and Views modules.

Install
-------
Installing the Fivestar voting module is simple:

1) Copy the fivestar folder to the modules folder in your installation.

2) Enable the module using Administer -> Modules (/admin/build/modules)

Note: Aggressive caching will complain that fivestar doesn't work, but it
actually causes no problems. To improve performance, the module implements
hook_init() -- and the caching advisor screen uses that as the only metric to
determine whether a module will work with the caching system. Activate it
without fear, friends -- Fivestar will continue to hum happily along.

Upgrading from Drupal 5
-----------------------
The Drupal 6 version of VotingAPI has been significantly improved for both
efficiency and flexibility. Because Fivestar depends on VotingAPI for much of
its functionality, these changes have affected Fivestar.

The Fivestar Anonymous vote interval set in admin/settings/fivestar is no
longer available. We use the same setting as defined in VotingAPI now, set at
admin/settings/votingapi. It has the same effect as the previous Fivestar
setting.

Configuration for Simple Rating
-------------------------------

Fivestar has two completely separate modes of operation. The first is letting an
end-user rate a piece of content. The settings for this are on the content type
settings page. These settings let you expose a rating widget when viewing the
node, not editing it. Clicking on the widget registers a vote for that node, and
never anything else.

The configuration for Fivestar is spread between the content type settings page,
Fivestar site settings page, and access permissions. To configure:

1) Configure the site-wide setting for Fivestar, Administer -> Settings ->
   Fivestar.

2) Activate voting on each content type. For example, if you want Fivestar to
   appear on story nodes, use Administer -> Content Management ->
   Content Types -> Story, and check the "Enable Fivestar rating" box under
   the "Fivestar ratings" heading. Repeat for each content type desired.

3) Enable anonymous voting.
   If you want to allow anonymous voting, you'll need to set permissions for
   that. Use Administer -> User Management -> Access Control, and check the
   "rate content" and "view ratings" checkboxes for the roles you'd like.
   You'll find these permission items under the "fivestar module" heading.

Configuration for Reviews of Content
------------------------------------

Fivestar can be used to quickly setup a rating system for your site visitors to
review a piece of content. When enabling the Comment widget, visitors will
submit a rating on the *original piece of content* along with their comment.
Visitors will not be rating the comments themselves. Fivestar does not allow for
the rating of comments.

1) If it's not already enabled, turn on comment module at Administer ->
   Site Building -> Modules.

2) Visit the content type you want to enable reviews, such as Administer ->
   Content Management -> Content Types -> Story, and select an option under
   the "Comment widget" section.

Configuration as a CCK field / Advanced Rating
----------------------------------------------

Fivestar has extensive CCK support, which makes it so that the user is presented
with a widget to rate some node with the widget while editing a node. It does
not necessary rate the current node, nor does it rate anything if no value is
entered in the Node ID field when configuring the CCK field. The value is
saved in the node (so when you edit it it is still there), but no vote is
registered in VotingAPI without the Node ID field filled out.

An example of a situation where you might want to use the CCK fivestar field is
creating a node type called 'review'. This review type would let users rate
some particular node, and accompany their rating with a review. This could be
combined with a standard rating on the target node, so that some users could
rate the target node using the simple method, or write a complete review to
accompany their rating.

To configure a CCK field for rating a node while creating a new 'review' node:

1) Create a new node type called 'review' at Administer -> Content Management ->
Content Types. Configure the type. Do NOT set any fivestar settings on the
content type form! We don't want users to actually be able to rate the reviews
themselves!

2) Edit your new content type, then click on the "Add Field" tab while on the
content type form. Add a field called 'rating' to your new type, make it of type
Fivestar Rating with the Stars radio button.

3) Configure the rating widget to your liking. Most field have help text which
explain their purpose. The Node ID field is the most important field on the page
which determines exactly what node will receive the value of the rating. In a
realy simple case, you could just enter the value 10 to always rate on the same
node with nid = 10.

A common scenario is using fivestar with nodecomments to make reviews. If using
nodecomments a separate checkbox appears the Node ID field to allow you easily
select the nodecomment parent as the target of the vote.

Save your field. Now when making new nodes of type 'review', the user will
select a star that will register a vote on the value of the Node ID field.

Views Integration
-----------------
Fivestar depends on the views integration provided by VotinAPI, but adds some
special features to make it work specifically with Fivestar. To display Fivestar
ratings in a view, select the "VotingAPI percent vote result" from the list of
available Fields. This will display the average vote for nodes. Then choose
"Fivestar rating" from the Handler options for the field and the averages will
be displayed as Fivestar ratings.

Fivestar also provides handling for the display of Fivestar CCK fields, they are
in the Field list under "Fivestar Rating: [Field name]".

Creating a Fivestar Set
-----------------------

1. Open your favorite image editor and create an image that is 3 times as high as it is wide.
   The default size for Fivestar (and the easiest to work with) is 16x48 pixels.

2. Setup guides at 16 pixels and 32 pixels. This splits your canvas into thirds.

3. Create a star icon in the top third. When satisfied, copy it into the middle and bottom
   thirds of the image. Change the middle and bottom copies to your liking. Fivestar will
   use the top, middle, and bottom images for each state of the star.
   
   Top      -> Off
   Middle   -> On
   Bottom   -> Hover

4. Save your image as "star.png" in a new directory. The name of your directory will be the label
   for your set of stars, spaces are not allowed.

5. Do the same thing for a cancel image, only there are only 2 states for a cancel image, so your
   image will be 16 pixels by 32pixels. Setup a guide at 16 pixels so your canvas is split in half.

6. Create a cancel icon in the top half. Then duplicate it into the bottom half. The cancel states
   are simply Off and Hover.

   Top      -> Off
   Bottom   -> Hover

7. Save your cancel image as "cancel.png" in the directory create in step 4.

8. Create the CSS stylesheet. The easiest way to make this stylesheet is to copy an existing CSS
   file from another set of stars. The "Basic" set provides an excellent example for a 16x16 star,
   because it only changes the background image as necessary. If you're making a larger or smaller
   size for your stars than 16x16 pixels, the "Minimal" and "Outline" sets make for a good example.
