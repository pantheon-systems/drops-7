/**
 * Define payment methods available to the Commerce Payment framework.
 *
 * The Payment module uses this hook to gather information on payment methods
 * defined by enabled modules.
 *
 * Payment methods depend on a variety of callbacks that are used to configure
 * the payment methods via Rules actions, integrate the payment method with the
 * checkout form, handle display and manipulation of transactions after the fact,
 * and allow for administrative payment entering after checkout. The Payment
 * module ships with payment method modules useful for testing and learning, but
 * all integrations with real payment providers will be provided as contributed
 * modules. The Payment module will include helper code designed to make different
 * types of payment services easier to integrate as mentioned above.
 *
 * Each payment method is an associative array with the following keys:
 *  - method_id: string identifying the payment method (must be a valid PHP
 *    identifier).
 *  - base (optional): string used as the base for callback names, each of which
 *    will be defaulted to [base]_[callback] unless explicitly set; defaults
 *    to the method_id if not set.
 *  - title: the translatable full title of the payment method, used in
 *    administrative interfaces.
 *  - display_title (optional): the title to display on forms where the payment
 *    method is selected and may include HTML for methods that require images and
 *    special descriptions; defaults to the title.
 *  - short_title (optional): an abbreviated title that may simply include the
 *    payment provider’s name as it makes sense to the customer (i.e. you would
 *    display PayPal, not PayPal WPS to a customer); defaults to the title.
 *  - description (optional): a translatable description of the payment method,
 *    including the nature of the payment and the payment gateway that actually
 *    captures the payment.
 *  - active (optional): TRUE of FALSE indicating whether or not the default
 *    payment method rule configuration for this payment method should be
 *    enabled by default; defaults to FALSE.
 *  - checkout (optional): TRUE or FALSE indicating whether or not payments can
 *    be processed via this payment method through the checkout form; defaults
 *    to TRUE.
 *  - terminal (optional): TRUE or FALSE indicating whether or not payments can
 *    be processed via this payment method through the administrative payment
 *    terminal on an order’s Payment tab; defaults to TRUE.
 *  - offsite (optional): TRUE or FALSE indicating whether or not the customer
 *    must be redirected offsite to put in their payment information; used
 *    specifically by the off-site payment redirect checkout pane; defaults to
 *    FALSE.
 *  - offsite_autoredirect (optional): TRUE or FALSE indicating whether or not
 *    the customer should be automatically redirected to an offsite payment site
 *    on the payment step of checkout; defaults to FALSE.
 *  - callbacks (optional): an array of callback function names for the various
 *    types of callback required for all the payment method operations, arguments
 *    per callback in parentheses:
 *      - settings_form: the name of the CALLBACK_commerce_payment_method_settings_form()
 *        of the payment method.
 *      - submit_form: the name of the CALLBACK_commerce_payment_method_submit_form()
 *        of the payment method.
 *      - submit_form_validate: the name of the CALLBACK_commerce_payment_method_submit_form_validate()
 *        of the payment method.
 *      - submit_form_submit: the name of the CALLBACK_commerce_payment_method_submit_form_submit()
 *        of the payment method.
 *      - redirect_form: the name of the CALLBACK_commerce_payment_method_redirect_form()
 *        of the payment method.
 *      - redirect_form_validate: the name of the CALLBACK_commerce_payment_method_redirect_form_validate()
 *        of the payment method.
 *      - redirect_form_submit: the name of the CALLBACK_commerce_payment_method_redirect_form_submit()
 *        of the payment method.
 *  - file (optional): the filepath of an include file relative to the method's
 *    module containing the callback functions for this method, allowing modules
 *    to store payment method code in include files that only get loaded when
 *    necessary (like the menu item file property).

/**
 * Defines payment transaction statuses.
 *
 * A payment transaction represents any attempted payment via a payment method

 * and parameters of the transaction. One of these is the transaction’s local
 * status, not to be confused with its remote_status that stores the exact
 * status of the transaction at the payment provider.
 *
 * Transaction statuses are used to visually represent in the order’s Payment
 * tab whether or not the payment should be considered a success (meaning money
 * was actually collected) and are accordingly considered when calculating the
 * remaining balance of an order. Because payment statuses are critical
 * functionality components, the default statuses listed below are actually
 * defined in the function used to load all payment transaction statuses:
 * - Pending: further action is required to determine if the attempted payment
 *   was a success or failure; used for payment methods like e-checks that may
 *   require time to clear or credit card authorizations that haven’t been
 *   captured yet
 * - Success: the transaction is complete and a success, meaning the amount of
 *   this transaction will be subtracted from the order total to determine the
 *   outstanding balance on the order
 * - Failure: the attempted transaction failed and will not be counted in totals
 *
 * Additional statuses may be defined via this hook, but there is no general
 * alteration. The properties of the default statuses may be altered as long as
 * the actual status key is preserved via the use of array merging.
 *
 * The payment transaction status array structure is as follows:
 * - status: machine-name identifying the payment transaction status using
 *   lowercase alphanumeric characters, -, and _
 * - title: the translatable title of the transaction status, used in
 *   administrative interfaces
 * - icon: the path to the status’s icon relative to the Drupal root directory
 * - total: TRUE or FALSE indicating whether or not transactions in this
 *   status should be totaled to determine the balance of an order
 *
 * @return
 *   An array of payment transaction status arrays keyed by status.

 * @see commerce_payment_transaction_statuses()
