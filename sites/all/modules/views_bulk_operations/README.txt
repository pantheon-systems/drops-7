Views Bulk Operations augments Views by allowing bulk operations
(provided by Drupal core or Rules)  to be executed on the displayed rows.
It does so by showing a checkbox in front of each displayed row, and adding a
select box on top of the View containing operations that can be applied.

Getting started
-----------------
1. Create a View.
2. Add a "Bulk operations" field, available to all entity types.
3. Configure the field by selecting at least one operation.
4. Go to the View page. VBO functionality should be present.
