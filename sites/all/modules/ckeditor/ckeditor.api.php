 * CKEditor Module for Drupal 7.x
 *
 * This module allows Drupal to replace textarea fields with CKEditor.
 *
 * CKEditor is an online rich text editor that can be embedded inside web pages.
 * It is a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor which means that the
 * text edited in it looks as similar as possible to the results end users will
 * see after the document gets published. It brings to the Web popular editing
 * features found in desktop word processors such as Microsoft Word and
 * OpenOffice.org Writer. CKEditor is truly lightweight and does not require any
 * kind of installation on the client computer.
