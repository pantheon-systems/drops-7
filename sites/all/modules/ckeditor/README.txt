About CKEditor for Drupal
-------------------------
This module allows Drupal to replace textarea fields with CKEditor.
CKEditor is an online rich text editor that can be embedded inside web pages.
It is a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor which means that the
text edited in it looks as similar as possible to the results end users will
see after the document gets published. It brings to the Web popular editing
features found in desktop word processors such as Microsoft Word and
OpenOffice.org Writer. CKEditor is truly lightweight and does not require any
kind of installation on the client computer.
