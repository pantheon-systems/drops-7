There are some Drush commands available for Views, initially added in <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1079178">Drush command to revert views</a>:

<ul>
<li>views-dev (vd) -  Setup the views settings to a more developer oriented value</li>
<li>views-revert (vr) - Revert overridden views to their default state. Make backups first!</li>
</ul>

Examples:
drush views-revert
[prompts the user with a list of overridden views to choose from, or to revert all]

drush views-revert archive myview2
[reverts the two specified views]
