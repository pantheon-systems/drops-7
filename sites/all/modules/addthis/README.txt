-- SUMMARY --

Add This module provides Drupal integration to addthis.com link sharing service. Integration has been implemented as a field.

Description from addthis.com: 
The AddThis button spreads your content across the Web by making it easier for your visitors to bookmark and
share it with other people, again... and again... and again. This simple yet powerful button is very easy to 
install and provides valuable Analytics about the bookmarking and sharing activity of your users. AddThis helps 
your visitors create a buzz for your site and increase its popularity and ranking.

AddThis is already on hundreds of thousands of websites including SAP, TIME Magazine, Oracle, Freewebs, 
Entertainment Weekly, Topix, Lonely Planet, MapQuest, MySpace, PGA Tour, Tower Records, Squidoo, Zappos, Funny 
or Die, FOX, ABC, CBS, Glamour, PostSecret, WebMD, American Idol, and ReadWriteWeb, just to name a few. Each 
month our button is displayed 20 billion times.
