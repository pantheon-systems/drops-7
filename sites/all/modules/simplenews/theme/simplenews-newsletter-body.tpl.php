 * Default theme implementation to format the simplenews newsletter body.

 *   simplenews-newsletter-body--[view mode].tpl.php
 *   simplenews-newsletter-body--[tid]--[view mode].tpl.php
 * See README.txt for more details.
 *
 * Available variables:
 * - $build: Array as expected by render()
 * - $build['#node']: The $node object
 * - $title: Node title
 * - $language: Language code
 * - $view_mode: Active view mode
 * - $simplenews_theme: Contains the path to the configured mail theme.
 * - $simplenews_subscriber: The subscriber for which the newsletter is built.
 *   Note that depending on the used caching strategy, the generated body might
 *   be used for multiple subscribers. If you created personalized newsletters
 *   and can't use tokens for that, make sure to disable caching or write a
 *   custom caching strategy implemention.
